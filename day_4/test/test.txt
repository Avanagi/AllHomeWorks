He drew from under his buffalo robe what seemed like a long tress of
blond hair, and held it aloft, "

Patsey was off like a shot; his bare little red feet trembling under
him, "I'd like to go into one of them funny
holes," she said to herself, half aloud, "If you
please, Sir," she said, hurriedly, with an increasing colour and no
stops, "we're not always pirates, you know, and Wan Lee is only our
boy what brushes my shoes in the morning, and runs of errands, and
he doesn't mean anything bad, Sir, and we'd like to take him back
home with us, Beyond
the pleasant shadows where she sat, she saw the great world of
mountain and valley through a dreamy haze that seemed to rise from
the depths below and occasionally hang before the cavern like a
veil, But more remarkable
than all were the inmates of the cavern, who were ranged round the
walls; men, who like their attendants, seemed to be of extra
stature; who had blackened faces, wore red bandanna handkerchiefs
round their heads and their waists, and carried enormous knives and
pistols stuck in their belts, I first knew her as the Queen of the Pirate Isle, It
was a sound like coughing followed by something like an oath, It showed
itself in the roadside bushes; its red dust pervaded the leaves of
the overhanging laurel, it coloured their shoes and pinafores; I am

hands, It was also felt to be the first real step
towards independence; they looked down at their ensanguined
extremities and recognized the impossibility of their ever again

carrying tidings of great joy; that they stopped to rejoice
together, and that in some mysterious manner their conductors had
got their faces washed, and had become more like beings of the outer
world, The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work, The past seemed like a dream, Then the extended figure was seen to detach
what looked like a small black rope from its shoulders and throw it
to the girl, There were no frowning rocks to depress the
children's fancy, but everywhere along the ridge pure white quartz
bared itself through the red earth like smiling teeth, the very
pebbles they played with were streaked with shining mica like bits
of looking-glass, They accepted
everything with the confidence and credulity of all children who
have no experience to compare with their first impressions and to
whom the future contains nothing impossible, Wan Lee, whose silent, stolid, mechanical
